## 📦 Installation

### Step 1: Install Rust

If you haven't installed Rust yet, run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the prompts and select option **1** for default installation.

### Step 2: Configure Your Shell

```bash
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

**Expected output:**
```
rustc 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26)
cargo 1.83.0 (5ffbef321 2024-10-29)
```

### Step 4: Clone or Create the Project

**Option A: Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd hello_world
```

**Option B: Create from scratch**
```bash
cargo new hello_world
cd hello_world
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Program

There are two ways to run this program:

#### Method 1: Build and Run (Development Mode)

```bash
cargo run
```

**Output:**
```
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (/path/to/hello_world)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.50s
     Running `target/debug/hello_world`
Hello, world!, i'm learning rust
```

#### Method 2: Build Then Execute

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the executable
./target/debug/hello_world
```

### Building for Release

For an optimized production build:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/hello_world
```

### Checking Code Without Building

```bash
cargo check
```

## 🎓 What I Learned

Through building this project, I gained understanding of:

### 1. **Cargo Basics**
- Creating new projects with `cargo new`
- Building projects with `cargo build`
- Running projects with `cargo run`
- Understanding Cargo's project structure

### 2. **Rust Fundamentals**
- The `fn main()` function as the program entry point
- Using the `println!` macro for console output
- Rust's syntax requirements (semicolons, braces)
- The difference between macros (`!`) and functions

### 3. **Project Structure**
- How Rust organizes source code in the `src/` directory
- The purpose of `Cargo.toml` for project configuration
- How the `target/` directory stores compiled artifacts
- Debug vs. Release build differences

### 4. **Compilation Process**
- Rust's ahead-of-time compilation model
- The role of the Rust compiler (`rustc`)
- How Cargo manages the build process
- Understanding compilation output and artifacts

### 5. **Development Workflow**
- Edit → Build → Run cycle
- Using `cargo check` for faster feedback
- Interpreting compiler messages and errors
